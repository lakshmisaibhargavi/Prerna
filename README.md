# Prerna

## Introduction
Have you ever thought, what is the floral condition in your area? What is the state of nature in other parts of the world? 
Haven’t you felt the need to have a travel experience during the pandemic?

If your answer for any of the above questions is yes, we have a solution for you where the social well-being is profitable and fun.

We, Team Binary, bring you this project - PRERNA, an ideal social welfare solution towards a better world. It’s a user-friendly app that connects you to the world. 

## Inspiration

Every travel enthusiast strives to get time over their busy schedule and enjoy the world in his own way. The pandemic has created such a situation where its hard for a common person to cross all the barriers and enjoy his freedom of travelling. Besides travelling, people tend to move towards locations which are lush green and indulged in ecosystems.

This ideology has led us in coming up with an innovative solution, where the user of our app gets incentives for planting a sapling and uploading it’s images of successive growth, which in return helps us gain an insight of the plant-related data. On the other hand, to benefit travel enthusiasts, we offer VR experience of several tourist spots, with the help of the street view images uploaded by our users. Moreover, we also act as a bridge between the artists and the art-lovers. This app becomes handy, to explore several artworks to buy or rent.

## Solution

The main source of the income is the exchange of information/data, plant panorama images collected from the user include the data such as mean sea level, precipitation, N2-CO2-O2 levels in air, soil type and average temperature of that day.

This data helps an agriculturist or a hortico to come up with an overview on the plant growth over different circumstances. This gives a broad look on the aspects of interspecies differentiation. The data is analysed with the help of ML models in reverification of the type of the plant, identifying the soil type, extraction of external factors that influence the plant (Temperature, humidity, moisture content), presence of diseases and several micronutrients in soil like nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium, etc. To get untampered data, we are using blockchain to store in the value

Perspective over a particular place differs on how we see it, people who have already visited a place, might not find it interesting as they lack the vision to see the beauty in and around the place. They might not have access to visit the place, such as caves, high altitude places, deep sea diving, extreme weather places, outer space experience too, but these places might contain a separate world in it. Due to financial, time and health issues may not be able to experience it. 


## What makes it more awesome compared to previous solutions?

We bring this experience to your reach, as a package within your pocket-money. A user can share their perspective and increase their market and opportunities to explore the chances as a travel blogger and get sponsor benefits. 

As this is a global scale project, the process of getting these incentives is being done with the help of smart contracts through ethereum, for safer and faster transactions, removing the barrier of national currencies, 



## Challenges we ran into

Using 360 degree panoramical images and converting them as a virtual immerssive experience....Maintaining the ML model accuracy, combining smart contracts together to attain various features.

## Upgradations in the future

Better sticiting of panoramical images into VR experience
Clarity of the 360 degree image (Location)
Data extraction
Vizualisation of collected data
